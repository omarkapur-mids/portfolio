									<h2><a href="#">LiveStalk<br />Tracking Cows with Drones
									</a></h2>
								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/rjenez/w251-final-project-livestalk" class="image fit"><img src="images/livestalk.png" alt="" /></a>
								<justify><p>In the final project for the class Deep Learning in the Cloud and at the Edge, my team developed a drone-based application
									that allowed a drone to be flown on a predetermined path over any area and perform object detection to identify cattle. As this was a 
									proof-of-concept and we used a DJI Mavic Pro drone, we were unable to access an on-board API for model deployment and instead performed
									the drone run and then transferred the video to a Jetson Nano. From this device, object detection was performed on the video feed and 
									the output was sent to an AWS instance using MQTT, where it was then mapped. A simple front-end UI allows the user to see the cow locations,
									counts, and images with annotations. YOLOv5 was used as the object detection model, and through the exploratory approach of how to best 
									collect the data we experimented with different datasets and ultimately were able to train a model that performed with over 0.9 mAP on 
									our holdout test set.

									<h2><a href="#">Exploring Data Augmentation for Question Answering with T5<br />
									</a></h2>
								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/omarkapur-mids/Exploring-Data-Augmentation-for-QA-with-T5" class="image fit"><img src="images/T5.png" alt="" /></a>
								<justify><p>This project was an attempt to find ways of improving T5's performance on a difficult Question Answering task, using the DROP 
									(Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs) dataset as a benchmark. We experimented with transfer learning on a variety of datasets, and 
									 found that we could improve performance by generating our own synthetic Question Answer data. While our synthetic dataset ultimately was 
									 not diverse enough to train the model on it's own, but by augmenting the DROP training data with our synthetic data, we were able to avoid
									 overfitting and improve performance.

									<h2><a href="#">Birdwatch<br />
									</a></h2>
								</header>
								<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/midsw251birds2021/leaderboard" class="image fit"><img src="images/birdwatch.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This project was an in-class Kaggle competition requiring accurate image classification on bird photographs in a dataset with 270 different 
									classes of birds. Using Vision Transformers, I was able to achieve over 98% accuracy on the test set (the best performing model was SWIN). 
									This was also achieved by applying label smoothing to the cross entropy loss function, a cosine learning rate scheduler, and  
									stochastic gradient decent with momentum and weight decay.

									<h2><a href="#">Flight Delay predictions<br />
									</a></h2>
								</header>
								<p>For this project, we had to predict whether a flight would be at least 15 minutes delayed 2 hours before the scheduled departure using 
									large datasets of airline flights (all US commercial flights from 2015-2019) and weather data (NOAA data 
									collected from 2015-2019). Because of the size of the dataset, distributed computing was required (PySpark). The modeling portion of 
									the pipeline used logistic regression as a baseline, which was improved upon using Gradient Boosted Trees and XGBoost. The computation 
									was performed in Databricks.
