									<h2>Who am I?<br />
									</h2>
									<center><a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></a></center>
									<justify><p>From a professional
									perspective, I'm someone who loves to solve data challenges in ways that generate
									real value. I have diverse work experience, but most recently I've been primarily developing
									and managing full stack data pipelines for data science and engineering applications.</p>
									<h3><b>Career backstory:</b></h3>
									<h2></h2>
									<p>I did my bachelor's in structural engineering, and worked as an engineering
									consultant primarily to federal clients. Here I deployed into post-disaster situations and analyzed
									the failure of buildings and infrastructure. This involved researching ways to improve resiliency in the
									building code, representing my clients in proceedings for official building standards, and writing
									publications, giving presentations, teaching courses, and managing projects.
									<br /><br />
									In 2015 I completed an MBA, with a focus on analytics and information systems. I began working in
									software development consulting, with clients primarily in public health. Working on data projects,
									I knew I wanted to explore the craft of data science. I began to develop pipelines that automated  
									the validation of data from ETLs for data warehousing and production update processes. 
									<br /><br />
									This work provided me with data wrangling and cleaning experience while improving our ability to deliver
									on data projects. As a result, I had the opportunity to mentor junior data engineers as we expanded the 
									use of this role. I also worked in data governance, strategy, and analytics, working with agency senior 
									staff to develop requirements and building pipelines with Python and SQL that provided my client's with
									new and better ways to measure the impact of their agency. 
									<br /><br />
									As I grew my skills from data engineering and analytics work, I also studied Data Science and Machine Learning
									with online coursework and learning platforms. I was able to find opportunities for machine learning applications
									that provided value to the client and were worthy of new funding. While educating non-technical stakeholders about 
									machine learning capabilities, I brainstormed use-cases for ML products, developed working prototypes, and presented 
									them to agency decision makers, which led to new, funded data science projects and a growing data science team.
									<br /><br />
									While developing a data science presence at a large agency, I enrolled in UC Berkeley's Masters of Information 
									and Data Science (MIDS) program. This both reinforced my foundational skills and gave me instruction in cutting edge 
									data science techniques and applications. In my advanced courses, I've focused on Distributed Computing, Natural Language Processing, 
									and Computer Vision. For more information on some of the projects I've worked on both through work and school, please check out the 
									the other tabs.
